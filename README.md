## ✅ What Makes a Password Strong?

- Minimum **12–16 characters**
- Mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid using **names**, **birthdays**, or **common words**
- Don't reuse the same password across platforms

## 🔐 Password Tips I Learned

1. Use longer passwords whenever possible
2. Include special characters like `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.
3. Avoid sequences like `1234`, `abcd`, or `qwerty`
4. Use a **passphrase** — a sentence or group of words that's easier to remember and hard to guess (e.g., `Sunlight$Is#Bright2025`)
5. Use a **password manager** to store and generate strong passwords
6. Always turn on **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for important accounts

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
Tries every possible character combination until it finds the right one. **Longer and complex passwords** take too long to break.

### Dictionary Attack
Uses a list of commonly used words or passwords to guess yours. **Avoid real words** or simple variations of them.

## 🔑 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
MFA adds a second layer of security:
- Example: You enter your password **and** a one-time code sent to your phone.
- Even if your password is leaked, your account stays protected.

---

## 📘 What is a Passphrase?
A **passphrase** is a group of words or a sentence:
- Example: `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!`
- Easier to remember and harder to crack due to length

---

## 🔁 Role of Password Managers
- Securely store your passwords
- Generate strong and random passwords
- Help you avoid password reuse
- Examples: **Bitwarden**, **LastPass**, **1Password**
